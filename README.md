# **IoT Digital Twin for Physiological Signal Analysis in Human-Machine Interaction - Bachelor thesis**

  

## Aim and objectives:

The aim of the thesis is to investigate and evaluate how Digital Twins can be effectively applied to solve physical assets, heterogeneity and support real-time biosignals analysis in Human-Machine interaction scenarios. The thesis focused on biomedical signal analysis and development of Digital Twin architecture. In particular, the physiological signals employed are ECG and EDA.

  

## Structure of the project:

To do so, the project has been divided in three main brances:

*   usage of the [board](https://www.pluxbiosignals.com/pages/bitalino) employed for signal detection;
*   preprocessing and biosignals analysis;
*   development of Digital Twin with [WLDT](https://github.com/wldt) library;
